Windf is a set of tools to generate meteorological symbols. 

Currently two tools are available: windarr lets you generate an image of a
wind arrow showing wind speed and direction. It is a common symbol in weather
maps. The second tool is windp. It generates an image showing the probability
of wind speed and direction based on a set of speed/direction value pairs.

Windf is released under GPL.
